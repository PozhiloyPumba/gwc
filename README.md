This repo was create for working with llvm. If we write LLVM (in upper case) we get Roman numbers let's add all of them.
$$L + L + V + M = 50 + 50 + 5 + 1000 = 1105$$
1105 is green wooden cock's (**GWC**) year in chinese calendar. Donâ€™t try to understand how I got to these current ideas.

I'm not crazy (at least I hope)...
